# Agents

One bar icon and one panel for every AI coding subscription on the machine.
A port of [omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy)'s Quickshell `agents`
plugin (`shell/plugins/agents` on the `quattro` branch) to Noctalia.

The plugin is strictly a display: it watches the usage records that
`bin/agents-usage-update` writes to `~/.local/state/noctalia-agents/usage/`
and draws whatever appears there. `bar.luau` owns the bar icon, `panel.luau`
the dashboard, and `service.luau` discovers and watches the records (and
handles the optional cross-device aggregation).

## Panel

- **Hero** — the mark, the tool, and the plan it runs on ("Max 20x", "Pro").
  Auth and endpoint problems replace the plan line and repeat in a card.
- **Subscription switch** — one chip per enabled agent (`h`/`l` or click).
  It appears only when more than one agent is enabled.
- **Limits** — the percentage of each allowance used, a matching meter, and
  the time until the session or weekly window resets.
- **Balance** — prepaid agents report a credit ledger instead of limits:
  remaining credit, a fuel-gauge meter that drains toward empty, and
  funded-versus-spent detail.
- **Tokens by day** — one row per day for the last week: day, bar, tokens,
  with today bolded at the bottom. Hover today for its prompt and session
  count.
- **Tokens by model** — tokens per model with each bar scaled to the heaviest
  model, the same way the weekly chart scales to its busiest day. Hover for
  the input / output / cache split.

A subscription appears only when it is enabled in settings and has actually
recorded usage — on this machine or on a synced one. With one such agent
there is no switch row at all; with none, the widget hides itself rather than
sitting in the bar with nothing to say. A CLI installed mid-session shows up
at the next refresh, so nothing polls the disk waiting for it.

## Data

Each agent is one JSON record in `~/.local/state/noctalia-agents/usage/`,
written by `bin/agents-usage-update`. That command runs one
`bin/agents-usage-<agent>` collector per agent; the service invokes it on its
refresh timer and whenever you ask for a refresh, and picks up any record that
lands in the directory regardless of who wrote it.

Adding an agent therefore never touches the Luau: ship a collector that prints
the record contract (see the `claude` and `codex` collectors) and the panel
gains a tab. An `assets/<id>.svg` mark is optional — with an
`assets/<id>-light.svg` twin if the mark needs a dark variant for light
surfaces — and the bar glyph stands in when there is none.

| Collector | Limits | Local stats |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint (5-hour session + 7-day weekly) | `~/.claude/projects` transcripts, opencode sessions on an Anthropic provider, plus `stats-cache.json` and `history.jsonl` as fallback |
| `codex` | The Codex app-server RPC | native Codex CLI session files (plus pi and opencode sessions) |
| `fireworks` | Estimated prepaid balance: configured funding minus rated account costs | Fireworks billing API, grouped by day and model for the last 30 days |

The three collectors are omarchy's, vendored essentially verbatim: stdlib-only
Python 3, no omarchy runtime behind them. Only their namespaced paths changed —
scan caches now live under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/noctalia-agents/` and the Fireworks
configuration under `~/.config/noctalia-agents/fireworks.json`.

Claude limits need a signed-in CLI; without credentials the panel says so and
falls back to local stats only. A non-default Claude directory is honored via
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, Codex via `CODEX_HOME`. Fireworks reads
`FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` first, then
`~/.fireworks/auth.ini` (which `firectl set-api-key` creates), then the key
opencode stores in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` when Fireworks is
signed in there.

### Fireworks balance

The collector first asks the account's `:getBalance` endpoint for the real
prepaid ledger. That endpoint exists but is permission-gated, and as of August
2026 no console-issued API key passes it. Until Fireworks opens it to keys, the
collector falls back to estimating the balance from
`~/.config/noctalia-agents/fireworks.json`:

```json
{
  "accountId": "",
  "fundedAmount": 20,
  "fundedAt": "2026-07-01"
}
```

Set `fundedAmount` to the credits purchased and optionally `fundedAt` to the
purchase date; with no date, the collector uses the account creation time. It
subtracts rated account costs and the panel labels the result as estimated.
For a later top-up, increase `fundedAmount` by the new credit while keeping the
original `fundedAt`, so both the funding and spend still cover the same period.
Without a configured `fundedAmount` the tab still shows token usage, just no
balance.

## Interactions

- Bar icon: left = panel, right = launch agent, middle = next subscription.
- Panel: `h`/`l` switch subscription, `r` or Enter refresh, Esc closes.
- IPC:

  ```sh
  noctalia msg plugin johnschmidt/agents:bar all <open|close|toggle>
  noctalia msg plugin johnschmidt/agents:service all <refresh|next>
  ```

## Settings

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `refresh_interval` | `900` | How often the usage records regenerate |
| `disabled_agents` | *(empty)* | Agent ids to hide, one per entry |
| `launch_command` | `claude` | What right-clicking the bar icon runs in a terminal |
| `sync_enabled` | `false` | Write this machine's snapshot and merge the others |
| `sync_dir` | *(empty)* | A folder synced by Syncthing, Dropbox, rsync, … |
| `sync_file_name` | `<hostname>.json` | This machine's snapshot file |
| `sync_device_id` | hostname | Stable device name inside the snapshot |

Every discovered agent is enabled by default; list an id in `disabled_agents`
to hide a subscription that is installed. Disabled agents are also skipped when
the records regenerate.

With sync on, every `*.json` snapshot in the sync folder is merged, so today,
the last 7 days, and the all-time totals cover every machine you code on —
active days are unioned by date rather than summed. Rate limits and balances
stay per-account and are never merged. A record may declare `"scope":
"account"` when its stats are account-global rather than machine-local
(Fireworks' billing API); those merge by taking the widest value instead of
summing, so the same account synced from two machines is not counted twice.
The snapshot format is omarchy's, unchanged, so a fleet running either shell
still merges cleanly in both directions.

One caveat on "all-time": the Codex collector only reads native session files
touched in the last 30 days, and Fireworks requests the last 30 days from its
billing API, so their totals and day counts cover that window. Claude's cover
every transcript still on disk.

## What did not transfer

Three things upstream does that Noctalia's plugin API has no equivalent for:

- **`j`/`k` scrolling.** A plugin panel's scroll view has no programmatic
  offset — only `stickToBottom` and a scroll-to-bottom pulse — so the panel
  scrolls with the wheel only. It is sized so a single subscription needs no
  scrolling at all.
- **Hover tooltips.** `tooltip` exists on buttons, not on arbitrary rows, so
  the per-row detail upstream shows in a tooltip lands in a detail line under
  its section instead — same text, same hover.
- **Tab to the neighbouring bar panel.** Upstream's `switchPanel` is a
  Quickshell bar affordance with no plugin-facing counterpart.

The mark falls back by file existence rather than by watching an image load
fail: `assets/<id>-light.svg` is used on a light theme when it exists, else
`assets/<id>.svg`, else the bar glyph.
